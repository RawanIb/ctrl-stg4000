# STGx control API 
This guide is for installing the ctrl-stg4000 package and making it work for STG5.

### Install ctrl-stg4 repo
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/pyreiz/ctrl-stg4000.git
cd .\ctrl-stg4000\
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
#download and install the dll from mulitchannelsystems
python -m stg.install
```

### Chnages in order to make it work for STG5:
(Files after changes attached)
1. Use the updated McsUsbNet.dll from:
   multichannel systems (MCS) library to control MCS devices e.g. stimulus generator devices with examples. (
   URL: https://github.com/multichannelsystems/McsUsbNet_Examples.git).

* Make sure to use the right DLL_PATH in install.py

2. in stg/_wrapper/dll.py
    1. chnage def avialabl() to:
   ```
    def available() -> List[DeviceInfo]:
        "list all available MCS STGs connected over USB with this PC"
        deviceList = CMcsUsbListNet(DeviceEnumNet.MCS_DEVICE_USB)
        print("found %d devices" % (deviceList.Count))
    
        devices = []
        for dev_num in range(deviceList.Count):
            devices.append(deviceList.GetUsbListEntry(dev_num))
        return devices
   ````

    2. change in def _collect_properties(self):
       from:
       ```
       soft, hard = interface.GetStgVersionInfo("", "")
       ```
       to:
       ```
       _, soft, hard = interface.GetStgVersionInfo("", "")
       ```

3. in stg/_wrapper/downloadned.py, change in def download(), from:
   ```
         amplitudes = [System.Int32(a * 1000_000) for a in amplitudes_in_mA]
         durations = [System.UInt64(s * 1000) for s in durations_in_ms]
   ```
   to:
   ````
         amplitudes = [System.Int32(int(a * 1000_000)) for a in amplitudes_in_mA]
         durations = [System.UInt64(int(s * 1000)) for s in durations_in_ms]
   ````

* If not recognizing the stg module make sure to mark ctrl-stg4000 directory as Source Root. 
(Right-click->Mark directory as->Source Root)

RUN example_of_use to make sure everything is running!

Good Luck!
