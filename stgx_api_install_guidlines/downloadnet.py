class STG4000(STGX):
    """
    This class implements the interface to download, start and stop stimulation. 

    At this point, you should pay attention to two specific details. First, indexing starts at 0. That means, the first channel is channel 0. Second, there is a difference between channels and triggers for the STG. Triggers are mapped to channels according to a channelmap. That means a single trigger can start stimulation of a whole set of channels. During initialization of the STG, we give this a sensible default. That means, all triggers are mapped to the respective channels following diagonal identity, i.e. trigger 0 maps to channel 0. Use :meth:`~STG4000.diagonalize_triggermap` to repeat this normalization.


    Example
    -------

    .. code-block:: python

        import time
        from stg.api import STG4000
        
        stg = STG4000()
        stg.download(0,[1,-1, 0], [0.1, 0.1, 49.8])
        while True:
            time.sleep(0.5)    
            a.trigger()
            stg.start_stimulation([0])

    .. note::
       
       * Indexing starts at zero
       * Differentiate triggers and channels

    .. warning::
        
       Please note, that in download mode, the Python object and the STG do not share states. More specifically, once a program is downloaded to the STG, it stays downloaded, even if you delete the object, instantiate a new one or reboot the PC. You can enforce a clean state by rebooting the STG or explicitly downloading and thereby overwriting the channels after instantiation. This behavior was kept for three reasons. First, this is also the behavior of the MCS GUI, and therefore less non-intuitive if you come from this direction. Second, it clearly shows that in download mode, PC and STG are not coupled, i.e. once downloaded, you can trigger without any USB connection. Third, clearing the downloaded programs during instantiation (or deletion of the object) would prevent the user from common use cases like recovering the STG after a restart of the kernel, deletion of the object or unplugging the USB cable.
